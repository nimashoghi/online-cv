    papers:
        - title: Secure Location Aware Authentication and Communication Protocol for Autonomous Systems
          authors: Ramyad Hadidi, Nima Shoghi, Bahar Asgari
          conference: Developed a secure and verified location-aware communication protocol for autonomous vehicles that uses asymmetric encryption to broadcast signed messages between vehicles, where encryption keys are shared visually (e.g., QR codes). Submitted to IROS 2020.
        - title: Context-Aware Task Handling in Resource-Constrained Robots with Virtualized Execution
          authors: Ramyad Hadidi, Nima Shoghi, Bahar Asgari
          conference: Devises a dynamic time-sharing mechanism that uses a robot’s sensor inputs to dynamically allocate Docker resources using reactive programming. Achieves a 42% speedup compared to the Linux scheduler. Submitted to IROS 2020.
        - title: "PISCES: Power-Aware Implementation of SLAM by Customizing Efficient Sparse Algebra"
          authors: Bahar Asgari, Ramyad Hadidi, Nima Shoghi
          conference: Implements a power-efficient SLAM algorithm on the FPGA by exploiting the sparsity of SLAM algorithms. Consumes 2.5× less power and is 7.4× faster than the state-of-the-art. Accepted into Design Automation Conference 2020.
